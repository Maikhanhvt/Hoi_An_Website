        <h1>Full Moon Festival</h1>

        <p>Since 1998, the Hội An municipal government has hosted the Full Moon Festival on the 14th night of each lunar month, from 5 to 10 p.m.
        This unique initiative was proposed by Polish architect Kazimierz Kwiatkowski, who dedicated himself to preserving Hội An Ancient Town
        and Mỹ Sơn Sanctuary, both UNESCO World Heritage Sites. During the festival, all households, including shops and restaurants, turn off
        electric lights, allowing the moonlight and lanterns to illuminate the streets. Vehicles are prohibited, and the streets are reserved
        for pedestrians. Activities include music performances, folk games, chess, bầu nậm card-singing, and lantern displays. During major festivals,
        additional events such as masquerades, poetry recitals, and lion dances enhance the cultural experience. The Full Moon Festival immerses
        visitors in the ambiance of Hội An’s centuries-old heritage.</p>

        <p>To celebrate sister city status with Wernigerode, Germany, selected residents of Hội An lead a replica of the lantern festival as a sign
        of respect towards Vietnam-Germany relations.</p>

        <i><b>Fun Fact!</b> In late 2018, Hoi An and Wernigerode won the National German Sustainability Award 2019, describing it as a vivid
            illustration of sound cooperation between the two sides.</i>
