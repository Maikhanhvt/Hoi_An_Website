        <h1>Authenticity</h1>

        <p>Hoi An Ancient Town has retained its traditional wooden architecture and townscape in terms of plot size, materials, fa√ßade and roof line.
        Its original street plan, with buildings backing on to the river, with its infrastructure of quays, canals and bridges in its original setting,
        also remains. The historic landscape setting is also intact, consisting of a coastal environment of river, seashore, dunes and islands.
        Because most of the buildings were constructed in wood it is necessary for them to be repaired at intervals, and so many buildings with
        basic structures from the 17th and 18th centuries were renewed in the 19th century, using traditional methods of repair. There is currently
        no pressure to replace older buildings with new ones in modern materials such as concrete and corrugated iron.<p>
